# UnrealToolkit
Unreal Toolkit aims to make the process of packaging easier and potentially faster. With this program youâ€™re able to package an Unreal Engine game without ever needing to open up the Editor.

This program uses the Rust programming language for the backend and uses the [Tauri](https://tauri.app) windowing system which allows me to make the GUI from HTML and JavaScript. I aim for it to be cross-compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux.

Unreal Toolkit allows you to target multiple configurations and platforms, this makes it a versatile tool for game developers like myself.

## Features
- Easy to use
- Package multiple configurations
- Package client and server builds
- Uses less RAM than Unreal Editor (Which allow more threads for compiling faster)
- Ability to remove the crash reporter (reduces game size by 1.5GB, however makes crashes less user-friendly)

## Planned Features
- Ability to build lighting for all or selected maps
- Show and parse through log files from Unreal
- Allow user to automatically create zipped archive of builds after packaging
- Upload completed builds to external server
- Create manifest file with error-checking for multi-version production
